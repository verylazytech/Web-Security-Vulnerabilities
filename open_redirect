# Open Redirect Vulnerability Demonstration

This folder demonstrates the Open Redirect vulnerability using a Flask-based application.

## Vulnerability
The application allows a user to specify a `next` URL, and it redirects the user to that URL after a successful login. If the URL is not validated properly, attackers can redirect users to malicious sites.

## Files:
- `open_redirect_vulnerable_code.py`: The code demonstrating the vulnerable behavior.
- `fixed_open_redirect_code.py`: The code with a fix that validates the `next` URL.
- `exploit_example.py`: A simple script to exploit the vulnerability.
